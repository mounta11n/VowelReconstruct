Today is a sunny day. Leslie and Tim met in the park to have a picnic. They had sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade with them. As they enjoyed their lunch, they watched the birds flying by and the children playing on the playground. After the picnic, they decided to play a game of frisbee and then had cake. They had a great day and looked forward to spending another day in the park soon.
