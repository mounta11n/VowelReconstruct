Today is a sunny day. Leslie and Tom met in the park to have a picnic. They had sandwiches, fruit, and lemons with them. As they enjoyed their snacks, they watched the birds flying by and the children playing on the playground. After the picnic, they decided to play a game of frisbee and then had some cake. They had a great day and looked forward to spending another day in the park soon.
