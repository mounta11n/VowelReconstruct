### Easy:

Today is a sunny day. Lisa and Tom meet in the park to have a picnic. They have sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade with them. As they enjoy their snacks, they watch the birds flying by and the children playing on the playground. After the picnic, they decide to play a game of Frisbee and then have ice cream. They have a great day and look forward to spending another day at the park soon.

### Medium:

The smartphone has become an essential part of our lives. Early models allowed us to make phone calls and send short text messages. Over time, these devices have evolved into powerful computers that fit in our pockets. Today, a smartphone allows us to surf the web, check email, take photos, play games and use social media. However, there are also concerns about privacy and the ever-growing impact of technology on our daily lives. Despite these drawbacks, smartphones have revolutionized the way we communicate and interact.

### Challenging:

Solar radiation is critical to life on Earth. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae and certain bacteria use sunlight to create energy-rich compounds. They can use sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen. This process is the primary pathway by which energy enters the terrestrial ecosystem. Glucose serves as an energy source for plants themselves and for many other organisms, while oxygen is an indispensable element for the respiration of many living things. The study of photosynthesis contributes to the understanding of the mechanisms that make life on our planet possible and could help find sustainable solutions to the challenges related to climate change and food production.

### Text 1: Natural science

The formation of the solar system is a fascinating process that began about 4.6 billion years ago and was triggered by the collapse of an interstellar cloud of gas and dust. Stellar nucleosynthesis led to the formation of various elements, which in turn contributed to the formation of planets and other celestial bodies. At the heart of the solar system, the Sun - a G-type main sequence star - was formed, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the system.

Gravity played a crucial role in the organization of matter and the birth of the planets. These celestial bodies, divided into terrestrial and gas or ice giants, evolved over millions of years. The terrestrial planets, namely Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are characterized by rocky surfaces and dense silicate and metal cores. In contrast, the gas and ice giants, including Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are composed largely of lighter elements such as hydrogen, helium, ammonia, and methane.

The discovery of exoplanets in recent decades has expanded our understanding of the diversity of planetary systems and reveals the complex interplay of factors that can ultimately contribute to the formation of life forms like ours.

### Text 2: Philosophy

Immanuel Kant, an influential philosopher of the 18th century, played a crucial role in the development of modern philosophical thought. In his most famous work, Critique of Pure Reason, Kant explores the limits and possibilities of human knowledge and introduces the idea of transcendental philosophy.

A core principle of his philosophy is the notion of the "thing-in-itself," which states that human experience can only know the world through the structures and conditions of human perception. Thus, the "thing-in-itself" - that which exists independently of our perception - remains inaccessible to the human mind.

In addition, Kant also shaped moral philosophy through his Categorical Imperative, which serves as the basis for ethical action. This principle states that actions are moral only if they are based on a maxim that can be universalized. This means that individual actions are considered ethical only if they can serve as a guiding principle for all people equally.

### Text 3: History

The Industrial Revolution, which began in the 18th century, was an era of significant technological, social, and economic change. It began in Great Britain and subsequently spread to other parts of Europe and North America. A series of innovations in the textile industry, mechanical engineering, steam power, and railroads made possible new efficient methods of production.

The massive changes brought about by this revolution also had profound social implications. Agriculture underwent an agrarian revolution that led to increased food production. As a result, large cities formed as the labor force moved from rural areas toward factories. This led to crowded and unhealthy living conditions that ushered in the rise of social reforms to improve the quality of life for workers.

The Industrial Revolution is often seen as a turning point in history that paved the way for modern society and set the stage for further technological, economic and social developments. The upheavals of this time period enabled unprecedented global interconnectedness and the beginning of international trade, which remains a driving force in the world economy today.

However, the Industrial Revolution also brought disadvantages. With rapid urban growth and the expansion of industrial production, environmental problems such as air and water pollution grew. In addition, the change led to the exploitation of the labor force, which often suffered from extreme conditions, low wages and long working hours.

As a result, political ideologies such as socialism and communism emerged that focused on the welfare of workers and sought to counteract inequalities and exploitation. These ideologies played a major role in shaping the world political order and led to significant changes in the political landscape of the 19th and 20th centuries.

The Industrial Revolution is thus a pivotal chapter in history that brought progress and challenges in equal measure. It highlights the duality of technological developments and their impact on society and the environment, a topic that remains relevant today.
