Today is a sunny day. Lisa and Tom meet in the park to have a picnic. They have sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade with them. As they enjoy their snacks, they watch the birds flying by and the children playing on the playground. After the picnic, they decide to play a game of Frisbee and then have ice cream. They have a great day and look forward to spending another day at the park soon.
