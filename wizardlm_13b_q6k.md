Today is a sunny day. Let's have a picnic in the park to have some fun. They have sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade with them. As they enjoy the snacks, they watch the birds flying by and the children playing on the playground. After the picnic, they decided to play a game of Frisbee and then had cake. They had a great day and looked forward to spending another day in the park soon.
