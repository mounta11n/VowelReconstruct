Today is a sunny day. Let's go and meet in the park. We are having a picnic. They have sandwiches, fruit, and lemonade with them. If they
enjoy their snacks, they watch the birds flying by and the children playing in the playground. After the picnic, they decide to play a game of Frisbee and then have some cream.
