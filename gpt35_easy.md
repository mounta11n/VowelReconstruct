"Today is a sunny day. Lassie and Tim meet in the park to have a picnic. They have sandwiches, fruit, and lemon with them. As they enjoy their snacks, they watch the birds flying by and the children playing in the playground. After the picnic, they decided to play a game of Frisbee and then have ice cream. They have a great day and look forward to spending another day at the park soon."
